 The application features a user-friendly interface for manual data entry. 
 The software will be structured using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to ensure
 a clear separation of concerns, enhancing maintainability and scalability. 
 The data will be stored in a relational database. The data can be visualized in several ways (e.g.:pie chart diagram) based on the aspects of the user. 
 In addition to the visualization several filters will be added to aid better understanding of the money spendings.
